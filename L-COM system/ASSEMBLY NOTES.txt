REMOVE ALL FLUX. VERY IMPORTANT.

Causing issues with the thermistor and power. Saw some arcing across it with the 5V and regulator.

ENSURE AL COMPONENTS ARE SOLDERED AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE.

Having them angled, especially the closely packed resistors/capacitors, can also result in arcing and unable to clean solder between them.

FLUX VERY BAD.

Either it was the flux between the module pads, or the flux between antenna ground and the antenna (at the SMA connector).
Actually, seems like its due to these intermitent power issues, but it atleast receives a clear message now.
Power issues possibly between the capacitor and recom?



Get proper flux for electronics.
DO NOT use no-clean flux.
Already have good flux remover!


Buy premade cables to avoid unreliable connections. For the rest of these, find a higher guage wire so they can form a better connection.
