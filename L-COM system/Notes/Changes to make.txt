Flip C1 and C2 to other side, give the inductor A LOT more space. Also, distance the ground plane more from the Vin.
Distance other components from the 5V RECOM regulator.

Arcing between components has been the main nemesis of this entire build. Mostly that inductor.



EBYTE:
DIO to digital pin 2 (PD2)
rx/tx 3,2 to 6,7


Sometimes needs pinMode(DIO1, INPUT_PULLUP); ?? I guess throw the line in in-case
