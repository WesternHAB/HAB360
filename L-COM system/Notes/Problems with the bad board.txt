The first board seems fine at max range settings, but the second one seems to suffer resets and hanging at the same settings.

Observations:
1. A quick press of the reset button doesn't work, need to hold it a bit longer.
2. Attaching the programmer cable (not attached yet to computer, so unpowered) causes the board to reset several times while the programmer powers up.
3. Arcing was observed between the 5V output (of Recom regulator) and ground due to leftover flux.
4. The inductor L1 is damaged.

What may be the issue:
1. Power supply issues

Specific issues:
1. I suspect the damaged inductor is a big one, as at low-power settings its fine, but upping it causes problems.
   This is also seen when attaching the programmer when its capacitors start charging.
   Thus, I suspect it is not able to provide as much power as it needs to be doing.
2. On a similar note, the Recom regulator may also be damaged by the arcing observed, and may cause similar issues.

Thus, it is likely one of those two components that are causing the issues. Most likely is the inductor due to the obvious damaged.
The Recom regulator is a bit more expensive and has built-in safety features, so I suspect it is probably fine.

Possible solutions:
1. See if its possible to solder the current inductor on better. Its floating quite a bit.
2. Replace with one of the cheaper inductors of the same value.
3. Remove the inductor entirely, and bridge the connection.

The inductor is most likely not necessary, although removing it may result in more noise.
