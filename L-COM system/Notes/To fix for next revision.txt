Correct SMA sizing: Molex one is wide, but $5 each. Theres the RF connectors one for $2 but smaller footprint. See if we can find the smaller footprint?
Give L1 and pin header space between them?
Flip all silkscreen text to match with the orientation of the EBYTE text.
Get the right 2-pin connector for power! The one that we had to buy is way too hard to take out without damaging it.




Probably not an issue but here in case:
Possibly move the power LED to after the fuse (If no fuse, e.g. didn't bother with Recom, then power LED won't turn on if powered by UART/pins).


Resistors: Used a 220 instead of 200 for LEDs.
Bought cheaper thermistor
Swap out for the smaller footprint SMA connector. For now, just adapt your own.


Need:
Connectors
Reset diode
Inductor
Clock source
Tantalum caps
10uF ceramics (??? do these even exist, did they mean 1uF?? Although I think I have them in the cart..)
SMA connector
Female header (can use male for now)
NO ICSP header now? (Too big?)
