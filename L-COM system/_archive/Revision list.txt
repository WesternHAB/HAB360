*No RF traces under module - Is very short now, directly to antenna
*TCXO instead of crystal, or use internal oscillator - Added TCXO
*3.3V regulator capacitors - Added
*GND under antenna line
*Higher-value resistance LEDs - Can just remove the pull-up resistor
*IN4148 instead of IN4007 - Done
*Wide power traces - Done
*Better power connector - Used a Molex Mini-lock
*Lots of vias under module
*I2C pullup resistors - Added 4K7 resistors pulling up to 3.3V
*Replace 0.1uF with 0.1uF and 0.01uF. Smaller value closer to chips - Done
*Swap out AMS1117 - Swapped out for TLV75733PDBVR
*Add vias around the board to avoid resonant structures
*Design RF trace for 50 ohm impedance



Antenna stuff, the antenna is already 50 ohms impedance.


At high altitude, RF outputdoesnt need to be high.
E.g. guy uses VHF and 50mW. Reduces output when altitude is above a couple thousand meters.

Avoid Elecrolytics at high altitude.




-----NEW-----
Replace SMA connector with https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/taoglas-limited/EMPCB-SMAFSTJ-B-HT/3522337 (Make sure its the right M/F).

Add a tantalum capacitor. Either type R or P (corresponds to 0805 footprint). Get atleast 10V, higher the capacitance the better.
