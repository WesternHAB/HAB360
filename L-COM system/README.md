# L-COM
This system is intended to serve as the communications system for high-altitude balloons and other devices in need of wireless communications.

The L-COM device may either be used as an attached radio by sending/receiving messages on the UART interface, or it may be programmed and be used as the sole onboard controller.

Initial testing in a low-power, low-range mode results in a range of about 1km in an urban environment with no line-of-sight. The devices were placed on the ground in a neighborhood with about 6 buildings directly in between them, and acheived a reliable >300bps data rate.
