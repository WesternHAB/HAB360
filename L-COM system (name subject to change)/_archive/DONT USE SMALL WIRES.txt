Seems theres was a ground wire that kept disconnecting, even though it was right in the holes. Perhaps internal damage to it?

Use jumper wires, and place them as close to the component in the rows as possible to minimize chances that there is a disconnect in the board.


Recent problem seems to have been with the power supply?

Jiggling wires seemed to affect it. Disconnecting the Recom 5V (since it wasnt supplied via jack) fixed it? But then put it back after and it still worked
