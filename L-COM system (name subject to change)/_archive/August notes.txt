Bootloader (need to burn a new one):
1.8V brownout
12MHz external

CH340G level shifts to 3.3V needed to program the ATMEGA. Uses 1K and 1.8K resistors to voltage divide (+1K pullup resistor for the LEDs)

Well it seems, DONT use untinned copper wires... They were adding a bunch of resistance to the circuit, making the ground on one side 0.3V higher.
It can be used for e.g. clocks and short stuff safely though I suppose.

Working great for 12 hours!


Default trace width is 6 mil. For 1A, need 6.8? Should up it more anyways.
Default trace spacing is 6 mil, which is Oshpark's requirments as well.

Can run at 3.3V

Added fuse to 5V line of USB.
Need over-voltage protection too though?
Don't need it on the D+ and D- since the CH340G can just get destroyed instead.

To do:
Add the thermistor to the PCB.
Add some wires to the small LEDs and inductor, try them out to make sure they don't blow.
Build up a list of parts, and see if we can get them all through Digikey (or related).
Rename components based on their position on the board.
