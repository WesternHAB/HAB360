-----------------------------------------------------

Need a process to initiate LoRa parameter changes mid-flight:

e.g. send a message to balloon to switch to these parameters.
Maybe send message, switch our own parameters as well.


1. Enter a period, e.g. 10 seconds of transmissions.

2. Each transceiver will send a message containing two bytes:
	1. How many times they have seen the other's message
	2. The byte value in the other's message
   Thus, we will know that THEY know we have seen their messages as well.

3. Once the period ends, and both byte values are one (or higher if incrementing continuously):
	Stay in this new transmission mode.
   If one of the byte values is still zero (one transceiver still hasn't seen the other):
	Revert back, or enter the highest-range mode.

-----------------------------------------------------

Data redundancy:

When transmitting status codes or data, we can choose to use a redundancy method by duplicating bytes, and taking a 'majority vote' in case one is different.

Redundancy modes: 1, 3?
	1: No redundancy, bytes are not duplicated. Packet length = max.
	3: 3x redundancy, 3 bytes for a single byte. PAcket length = max/3.

This can be defined in a LoRa library for the board itself? Settable through code (or config packets through serial).

-----------------------------------------------------

Repeater beacon:

A possible way to go about balloon recovery. Obviously the power supply onboard the balloon is limited, so we would like to conserve it.

Once landed, it can switch to a repeater mode where it is silent until it picks up messages. When it does, it transmits its own message once.
This way, it doesn't waste power transmitting messages when there is nothing nearby.

In this mode however, it should probably switch to the max-range settings.

Perhaps messages can be addressed to the attached payload system or comms module. If comms module and is labelled as a repeater message, responds appropriately.
Once landed, the payload system should otherwise be silent and let the comms module take over recovery.


-----------------------------------------------------

Addressing stuff?

Addressed to comms module:
-Parameter change initiation
-Repeater message
-Comms module status?

Address to payload:
-Payload things




More LoRa notes:
-People have gotten ranges of 138km WITHOUT an amplifier and with a OMNIDIRECTIONAL antenna.

Apparently a Yagi aerial antenna is ideal for chasing the balloon.
