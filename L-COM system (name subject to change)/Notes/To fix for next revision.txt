Correct SMA sizing: Molex one is wide, but $5 each. Theres the RF connectors one for $2 but smaller footprint. See if we can find the smaller footprint?
Direction markings for LEDs, tantalum capacitors.
Give L1 and pin header space between them.








Resistors: Used a 220 instead of 200 for LEDs.
Bought cheaper thermistor
Swap out for the smaller footprint SMA connector. For now, just adapt your own.


Need:
Connectors
Reset diode
Inductor
Clock source
Tantalum caps
10uF ceramics (??? do these even exist, did they mean 1uF?? Although I think I have them in the cart..)
SMA connector
Female header (can use male for now)
NO ICSP header now? (Too big?)
